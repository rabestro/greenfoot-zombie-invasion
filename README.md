# Zombie Invasion interactive simulation
Zombie Invasion interactive simulation developed in Greenfoot IDE and based on code in Chapter 3 of [Creative Greenfoot](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/creative-greenfoot) book by Michael Haungs.

> In the zombie simulation, we will watch a horde of zombies break through a wall and make their way to the homes on the other side. The user will be able to interact with the simulation by placing explosions in the simulation, that will destroy both types of zombies and the wall.
